# nonogram
This repo contains logic to create a nonogram out of an image, with a white background. When run, it randomly
selects an image from the `imgs` directory, and then produces a pixelized image, along with a nonogram puzzle
and its solution in the `results` directory.

## Sample command to run
`python nonogram.py`
